In the last few months I have been working on a real successor to Inferno Shoutbox, the project I undertook whilst learning PHP. As I was tweaking Inferno and improving the shoutbox, I realised that it would be much easier to create and maintain a shoutbox created by myself from scratch. Thunderbolt was born at that point.

Thunderbolt brings all the features you saw in the last major release of Inferno Shoutbox and accelerates the process threefold with an incredibly powerful Javascript engine and PHP backend. There's no more reason to accept the slower, clunkier, more confusing alternatives when you can have the best running on your forum.

Featuring an easy to learn and use interface, and sporting the all new Thunderbolt API, chatting online has never been so easy.

Screenshots of the shoutbox will be up by the end of the week. There will also be a private beta testing period as well as a public beta testing period.

There is currently no ETA for Thunderbolt however I will be posting updates here and on Thunderbolt's official website.
